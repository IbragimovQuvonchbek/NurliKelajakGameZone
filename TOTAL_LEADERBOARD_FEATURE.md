# Total Leaderboard Feature

## Overview
A new **Total Leaderboard** feature has been added to the Nurli Kelajak Game Zone project. This feature displays players ranked by their total points accumulated across all games.

## Features

### 1. Total Points Calculation
- Sums all scores from all games for each user
- Shows the combined total across all games
- Ranks users based on their total score

### 2. Time Filters
Players can filter the leaderboard by different time periods:
- **All Time** - Shows all scores from the beginning
- **Month** - Shows scores from the current month
- **Week** - Shows scores from the current week
- **Day** - Shows scores from today

### 3. Modern UI Design
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Medal icons for top 3 positions (gold, silver, bronze)
- Highlighted row for the current user
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Gradient backgrounds and modern color scheme

### 4. User Information
- User avatar display
- Username with profile link
- Last played date
- Total score displayed with comma formatting

## Files Modified/Created

### Views (`leaderboard/views.py`)
- Added `total_leaderboard` function that:
  - Accepts time filter parameter
  - Queries all GameScore records
  - Applies time filters if specified
  - Aggregates total scores using Django's `Sum()` aggregation
  - Returns top 100 players
  - Passes data to template

### URLs (`leaderboard/urls.py`)
- Added URL pattern: `path('total/', views.total_leaderboard, name='total_leaderboard')`

### Template (`leaderboard/templates/leaderboard/total_leaderboard.html`)
- Created new template with:
  - Beautiful header with trophy icon
  - Time filter buttons
  - Responsive table layout
  - Medal display for top 3
  - User avatars and information
  - Empty state handling

### Updated Leaderboards Home
- Added prominent "Umumiy Reyting" button to access total leaderboard
- Styled with gradient background and trophy icon

## How It Works

1. **Data Aggregation**: The view uses Django ORM's `Sum()` function to aggregate all scores per user
2. **Filtering**: Time-based filters are applied using Django's `filter()` method with date comparisons
3. **Ordering**: Results are ordered by total score in descending order
4. **Limit**: Top 100 players are displayed to keep performance optimal

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to the Leaderboards page
2. Click the "Umumiy Reyting" button
3. Select time filter if desired (All, Month, Week, Day)
4. View the rankings with total scores

### For Developers
```python
# Access the total leaderboard
from leaderboard.views import total_leaderboard

# URL pattern
urlpatterns = [
    path('total/', views.total_leaderboard, name='total_leaderboard'),
]
```

## Technical Details

### Database Query
```python
leaderboard = queryset.values(
    'user__username',
    'user__avatar'
).annotate(
    total_score=Sum('score'),
    last_played=Max('created_at')
).order_by('-total_score')[:100]
```

### Performance Considerations
- Limited to top 100 players for better performance
- Uses database aggregation (efficient)
- Minimal template processing
- Responsive CSS for mobile devices

## Future Enhancements
- Pagination for more than 100 players
- Export to CSV/PDF functionality
- Historical leaderboard snapshots
- Achievement badges for milestones
- Social sharing capabilities
- Email notifications for ranking changes
